        <div class="subheading mb-5">Psychology ðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, I am a student at the University of Riverside. I am 20 years old. My pronouns are she/her. I aspire to become a therapist in the future. I am currently studying Psychology and I am in progress to earn my Bachelor of Arts degree. I am a transfer student so I have already earned my associates and have some prior experience navigating college. I am also part of University of Riversideâ€™s honors program. Additionally, in community college I was also in their honorâ€™s program and graduated with a 4.0 G.P.A <br><br>

        As for my prior work experience I have been working in retail as a cashier for almost 2 years now. So, I am well acquainted with working with others. Prior to my cashiering experience I was a babysitter so I am good with working with kids. I have experience with being CPR trained and plan on renewing my certification. Even long before I entered the work force I have accumulated experience being in leadership positions. Some of which includes: being a volunteer for various organizations like food banks, stayed committed to doing MCJROTC for all 4 of my high school years, and even taking on the Secretary and ICC rep position for my community college's Psychology club. I also have experience with being a tutor.<br><br>

        When I am not working or participating in school you can find me comfy and cozy reading a book. Besides reading for fun; it helps me understand and be better acquainted with new perspectives unlike my own. I also really enjoy dabbling in the arts so you can catch me incorporating some variation of art in my free time. Specifically, I prefer making a keychain or sketching in my notebook. What some people may not know just by looking at me is I used to be a part of my high schoolâ€™s choir program. I would sing a variety of songs in a variety of places with my fellow classmates. Just by being a part of a fun but committed group was a great experience. So, throughout my life I have always been open to trying new things and I am still open to broadening my horizons. My favorite color is magenta. Yes, I might just be trying to reach the word requirement now. My go to pose is a peace sign. I am really fascinated by the concept of yin and yang. I am allergic to most animals such as dogs and cats, which is a bummer but I will still pet them, I am also allergic to horses. Honestly I think that it is a fur thing. Do the teacher assistants even check our websites? If you all do, send me an email. Love to hear what you think of this. My favorite song is Airplanes by B.O.B. featuring Hayley Williams. You should definitely check it out if you get a chance. I am a Dr.Pepper girly when it comes to drinking soda. "Everything is awesome"-Lego Movie.
